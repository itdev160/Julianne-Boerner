        <h2>What are hanging folders?</h2>
        <p>Hanging folders are the popular choice for desk drawer files.  They keep papers neatly in the file. The coated rod tips on the end of the folders slide easily
        on file drawers.</p>  
        <h2>Who makes Pendaflex hanging folders?</h2> 
        <p>The Oxford Filing Supply company is credited with the creation of the hanging file folder in 1939. The company through acquisitions later became known as Esselte Pendaflex.</p> 
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendalfex">
            <p>The company called its Pendaflex hanging file the <em>greatest development</em> in filing since the evolution of the filing
        folder.[1]</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <p>I have over 25 years of office experience and have used many office products but it didn't take long to realize Pendaflex was <del>better</del> <ins>best</ins> over all the other brands sold. Their poly reinforced edges make a sturdier folder that stand up to years of usage. With other brands I found myself constantly regluing the metal slide back into the folder and the folder buckling under the weight of papers inside as well ripping from the weight.  The lighter material inside the folder makes it easier to confirm that you are filing the papers inside the folder rather then in front of or behind the folder. The expansion folders/pocket folders make it nice if you have a lot of papers or magazines to put into the folder. With so many color options available it makes it easy to color code files and keep things organized.</p>
